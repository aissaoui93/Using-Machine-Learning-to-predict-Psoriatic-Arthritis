# Using-Machine-Learning-to-predict-Psoriatic-Arthritis
Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder that affects 2-3% of the population. Up to 30% of patients with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis, a debilitating condition affecting the joints that significantly lowers patients' quality of life. 



As psoriatic arthritis is characterized by a diverse set of clinical features, referral to a rheumatologist, diagnosis, and treatment is often delayed. A delay of even 1-2 years may result in irreparable joint damage. Thus, it is crucial to predict which psoriasis patients will develop psoriatic arthritis before onset of symptoms. 



The goal of this project is to implement machine learning methods to predict psoriatic arthritis patients from psoriasis patients using electronic medical record (EMR) and genotype data from ~86,000 samples from a large HMO.
